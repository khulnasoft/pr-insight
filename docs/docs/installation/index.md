# Installation

## Self-hosted Khulnasoft Merge
If you choose to host your own Khulnasoft Merge, you first need to acquire two tokens:

1. An OpenAI key from [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys), with access to GPT-4 (or a key for other [language models](https://pr-insight-docs.khulnasoft.com/usage-guide/changing_a_model/), if you prefer).
2. A GitHub\GitLab\BitBucket personal access token (classic), with the repo scope. [GitHub from [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens)]

There are several ways to use self-hosted Khulnasoft Merge:

- [Locally](./locally.md)
- [GitHub](./github.md)
- [GitLab](./gitlab.md)
- [BitBucket](./bitbucket.md)
- [Azure DevOps](./azure.md)

## Khulnasoft Merge Pro 💎
Khulnasoft Merge Pro, an app hosted by KhulnaSoft for GitHub\GitLab\BitBucket, is also available.
